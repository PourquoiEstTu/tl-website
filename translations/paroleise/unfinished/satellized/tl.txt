逸る風の音に
薫る季節さえ
今はすこし煩くて
かすれた文字を
指でなぞって
また同じような言葉を
呟く

Even the fragrant summer season
Is a little noisy now
Because/From [of] the sound/rustle of the exhilarating wind
With a finger,
I trace the blurred letters
Those similar words
Once again, I mutter them to myself

辿った道は
行方知れず
思い出しても
心  戻らぬまま

The path I followed / This path I've followed 
Led me to a place I don't know / I don't know where it leads/ends up/goes
Though I remember [what I was chasing/after / where I was going / where it leads]
My heart  (is unaffected and does not return)/(remains afar) /
	My heart doesn't/won't (spring back)/recover/return/(continues [as before] and does not turn back)

Alt
I became lost 
On the path I followed

未来遠く 駆け上がった
星の丘ゆく 果てなく

The future is distant, I dashed [up] to it / I dashed/rushed [up] to the distant future /
	I dashed [up] to it, that distant future
I go/continue up the hill of stars, endlessly

刺さるように  流れ込む
光になって  夜に消えた

The stars pour in, as if piercing me
I became light   and faded into the night

赤い日が 高く登るとき
空飛んで  迎えにきて
足は重く進まずとも
魔法唱えられるから
君とゆく

When the crimson sun rises/(is rising) high into the sky
I'll fly through the sky   and come meet you
No matter if my legs become heavy and I can't move forward
I can invoke/cast/chant my magic / I can chant spells / With a chant/invocation of my magic,
[So] I will reach/(get to) you

［未来といまの隙間
追いかけてる何か
丘のその向こうは限りなく］

[In the gap between now and the future
I'm chasing after something
It's beyond the hill, far off, and that distance/space is boundless/infinite] /
	Its on the far/other/opposite side of the hill, far off into the boundless distance]

［刺さる夜風が胸にもぐりこんで
照らす（光）になれず
その思いは消えた］

[The piercing wind (gets/sneaks in)/slips [into] my lungs
I can't become a shining (light)
And so that thought/hope/sentiment disappeared]
