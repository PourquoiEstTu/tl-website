抜けた羽根拾い集め火に焼べる
「灰になれ」と
堕ちた躯記憶ごと焼かれ忘れればいい

"Become ash" is what you say
As you pick up your fallen wings and throw/put/add them into the fire
Burn your fallen body, your memories, everything, and forget it/them all /
  Your fallen/ruined body, your memories, everything, burn them and forget them all

狭い籠で　雑音の中で
まだ君は生きているの？
背中を見て　君の羽根はまだ
飛び立てるだけの力があるから

In that tight cage, in the centre of all that noise
Are you still alive?
Looking at your back   Your wings still
Have just enough power to fly out, and that's why


変われ　さぁ　
鼓動を燃やして君は強く
もう　疎いものは捨て
笑ってくれ

Come now, transform/change[!]
(Your heart pounds with flames)/(your fiery heart pounds), you are strong
Those distant to you have been already cast off 
Smile [for me]

かさぶたは消えぬ傷に
爪を立てたあの日の夢
胸を裂き呼吸できぬ記憶も
焼き消せばいい

The scab from that wound that never disappears/heals
The dream of that day that made you (bury/dig your nails into it)/(pick at it)
Along with those memories that tear at your heart and leave you unable to breathe
Extinguish them with flames

餓鬼に呑まれふり解けぬまま
まだ君はそこにいるの？
背中を見て　抜け落ちた羽根が
前よりも強く生え変わったから

Engulfed by hungry spirits, unable to shake them off
Are you still in there?
Looking at your back   Your fallen wings have
been replaced by ones even stronger than before, and so

進め　さぁ
つまらぬ者など蹴散らせ
君の窮屈な籠はその手でぶち壊せ

Come now, advance
Thrash/(knock about) any insignificant fool
You can destroy your/that tight cage with your own hands

笑え　さぁ
鼓動を燃やした君は強い
もう　疎い者の無い所まで
炎の中へ
舞上がれ 舞上がれ
君が望む世界へと変わっていけ

Come now, laugh
With that fiery, pounding heart, you are strong
You are already in a place without anyone distant to you
Soar, fly high
Into the centre of the blaze
Change this into the world you dream of
