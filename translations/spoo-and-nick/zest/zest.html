			<h2>Translation Notes</h2>
			<p>
				I added in some spaces in lines where there was a fair bit of a gap between the vocalist singing the first half of a line and then the second 
				half. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I immediately ran into a roadblock with <span lang="ja-jp">"悪戯に壊れた　くだらないこの世界"</span>. <span lang="ja-jp">悪戯</span> generally means 
				mischief, prank, trick, fooling around, and those sorts of things. With how bleak Mary's view of the world seemed from this first stanza, I 
				didn't think that translating this line in a way where it felt "playful" would be accurate. "The world mischievously fell apart" is a translation
				I considered for that first little segment, but I don't think it carries much of a sense of negativity. So, I instead went with something 
				that I felt had a clearer scornful feeling. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another line I wasn't clear on was <span lang="ja-jp">"突然色付いた  歪んだこの世界"</span>, specifically, it's first segment. 
				<span lang="ja-jp">色付く</span> can simply mean "change colour", but it can also be more specific and refer to 
				leaves changing into the shades of 
				autumn or fruits ripening. At this point in the song, I think Mary has been with Renko for some amount of time and is having her view of the world 
				change and become more positive and hopeful. Maybe Mary's finally seeing the world in vivid colour instead of grey hues because she now enjoys 
				her life with Renko's company. It may be a weak connection, but the music video starts 
				out with a grey cityscape and then the colour of sunset appears later along with a strong red background when the chorus focuses on both Mary 
				and Renko. Alternatively, maybe Mary has finally noticed the beauty of autumn and the colours plants 
				take when it arrives. Or maybe Mary is realizing that time is passing and she doesn't have much left to spend with Renko. 
				The last two lines of this 
				stanza explicitly describe Mary coming to terms or at least trying to come to terms with saying goodbye to Renko, while the first four seem to 
				describe more of how Mary feels with Renko's introduction into her life, so I went with the more literal translation of the world suddenly seeming 
				to have colour in Mary's eyes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lastly, I felt extremely conflicted about the second segment of <span lang="ja-jp">幸せも悲しみも　愛せたならきっと...</span>. Although it wasn't 
				particularly difficult to translate, it affects the meaning of the song a fair bit. There were two possible translations to choose from. 
				Either Mary being able to love Renko, or Renko being able to love Mary. In my opinion, this song describes how Mary feels towards Renko as a 
				person who has recently entered into her life. 
				Mary enjoys being with Renko, Renko put colour into Mary's life, and Mary doesn't want to say goodbye. I think its clear that Mary feels gratitude 
				towards Renko since various lines throughout the verses and virtually the whole chorus point to that. It is more than possible that the song is 
				telling a story where Mary is coming to love Renko for what she's done for her,
				but I believe that it is also possible to interpret this as friendship or even a friendship that's turning into love. In particular, I think the 
				very clear <span lang="ja-jp">"知らない気持ちに戸惑う"</span> line along with the two line bridge verse near the end of the song suggest that 
				Mary is not very sure how she feels. She definitely feels happy and more optimistic than before Renko showing up in her life, but she's not 
				sure if she feels love and can't really process her new emotions well. I also think that if the line was meant to mean "If only you (Renko) could 
				have loved me (Mary)", then the passive form of <span lang="ja-jp">する</span>, <span lang="ja-jp">される</span>, would have been used instead. 
				In consideration of all this, I chose to go with the translation written. It then follows that the line means that maybe Mary wouldn't have to 
				say goodbye to Renko if Mary could fall in love with her, or maybe that she wouldn't be conflicted so by her feelings. Both translations 
				(though one is likely incorrect) lead to slightly different interpretations of the song with respect to the two's feelings about each other.
