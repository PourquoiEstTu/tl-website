逸る風の音に
薫る季節さえ
今はすこし煩くて
かすれた文字を
指でなぞって
また同じような言葉を
呟く

Even the fragrant seasons
Are a little noisy now
Because of the sound of the exhilarating wind
With a finger,
I trace the blurred letters
Those similar words
Again, I mutter them to myself

辿った道は
行方知れず
思い出しても
心  戻らぬまま

The path I followed
led me to a place I don't know
Though I remember [what I was chasing?/where I was going?]
My heart  is unaffected and does not return

未来遠く 駆け上がった
星の丘ゆく 果てなく

The future is distant, so I dashed [up] to it
I go up the hill of starts, endlessly

刺さるように  流れ込む
光になって  夜に消えた

The stars pour in, as if piercing me
I become light   and fade into the night

赤い日が 高く登るとき
空飛んで  迎えにきて
足は重く進まずとも
魔法唱えられるから
君とゆく

When the crimson sun rises high into the sky
I'll fly through the sky   to come to meet you
No matter if my legs become heavy and I can't move forward
I can invoke my magic / With a chant/invocation of my magic,
[So] I can reach you

［未来といまの隙間
追いかけてる何か
丘のその向こうは限りなく］

[In the gap between now and the future
I'm chasing after something
Far off, beyond the hill, is boundless/infinite]

［刺さる夜風が胸にもぐりこんで
照らす（光）になれず
その思いは消えた］

[The piercing wind finds its way into my chest
I can't become a shining (light)
And so that thought disappeared]
