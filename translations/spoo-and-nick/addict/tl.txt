悪戯に壊れた　くだらないこの世界
不安と寂しさが心締め付けて
悪戯に崩れた  つまらないこの世界
未来なんていらないよ
なのに突然君が僕の前に現れた
早く死にたいと思っていたけれど

It fell apart as if it was just playing a prank/It broke down like it was just a joke   
  This world is so worthless
Anxiety and loneliness clutch my heart
It crumbled like it was just a joke   This world is so boring
I don't need something like a future/I'm fine not having a future 
But even then/so you (showed up/appeared) (in front of me/before my eyes) so suddenly 
I (used to want/thought I wanted) to hurry up and die and yet

君と手を繋いだまま  僕等いつまでいよう
この喜びを返したい
君がいればもう少し
生きたいような気がするから
どうか　手を離さないで

With our hands held together  (I wonder) How long can we stay like this
I want to return you as much joy as you've given me/I want to repay you this joy you've given me/I want to give you as much joy as you've given me
[I'll be able to] If you're just here for a little longer/
  So just stay for a little longer/It'll only take a little longer if you just stay 
I've started feeling like I want to live [now] so,/I feel like I want to live, so, 
Please, don't let go of my hand 

突然華やいだ  小さなこの世界
君の声で僕の心は和らぐ
突然色付いた  歪んだこの世界
知らない気持ちに戸惑う
いつまでも隣で微笑んでいてと願うけれど
さよならを静かに覚悟してる

(Before I noticed) It suddenly became beautiful  This (oh so) small world
Your voice soothes my heart/My heart (softens/relaxes/calms) from the sound of your voice
It suddenly (became tinged with (vivid?) colour/hanged colours/changed colours)  This warped/distorted world 
I am confused (by/with?/due to) these unknown feelings (feelings i havent known/felt)/I'm lost in these new-found feelings 
I pray/wish for you to stay by my side smiling forever but 
I'm quietly preparing/resolving/readying myself to say goodbye 

君と手を繋いだまま  僕等いつまでいよう
この喜びを返したい
君がいればもう少し
生きたいような気がするから
どうか　手を離さないで

With our hands held together  How long can we stay like this
I want to return you this joy/I want to repay this joy/I want to give you joy too 
[I'll be able to] If you're just here for a little longer/
  So just stay for a little longer/It'll only take a little longer if you just stay 
I['ve started to] feel like I want to live [now] so,
Please, don't let go of my hand 


大切に思うほど感情が波を打つ
幸せも悲しみも  愛せたならきっと…

These feelings I consider so precious (roll around in me/are swelling/surge through me)
As do happiness and sadness  If I could have loved you then surely...

君と手を繋いだまま僕等いつまでいよう
この喜びを返したい
君がいればもう少し
生きたいような気がするから
どうか手を離さないで
