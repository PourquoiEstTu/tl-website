霧が晴れねぇぞ、どうなってんだ！？
洗濯物が乾かないじゃねえかよ、 誰の仕業だ、 早く出て来い！
また異変かよ、もうやってらんねえぜ…  面倒だけど、 一丁シメてくるか
上手い、早い、強いのハクレイミコが通る！

The fog ain't clearin' up, what the hell is goin' on!?
The damn laundry won't dry now, who did this?! You better show yourself now!
Another incident? (I can't deal with this)/(I can't be bothered)/(I don't care)/
	(I'm so over this)... It's a pain, but guess I'll go mop it up.
I'm skilled, I'm quick, I'm strong! The Hakurei Shrine Maiden is passing through!
                  
こんな短いスパンで異変に来られると　ガタついた足腰ももう持ちそうにねぇぞ…
面倒な事は大が付くほど嫌いだ、だが職務怠慢が出来るわけでもねぇ

To think that an incident could happen in such a short span of time... My shaky legs 
	won't last me 'till the end [of this]...
I hate these annoyances more than anything,  but I can't just ignore my stupid job 
	either.

私がやらなきゃ誰がやる　魔理沙の野郎には任せられねぇし…

If I don't fix this then who will. No way I can leave it to that idiot Marisa.

春が来ねぇぞ、どうなってんだ！？
花見しながら飲めないじゃねえかよ、 誰の仕業だ、 早く出て来い！
また異変かよ、もうやんなっちゃうぜ…　面倒だけど、 一丁シメてくるか
上手い、早い、強いのハクレイミコが通る！

Spring ain't comin', what the hell is goin' on!?
Now I can't drink with the cherry blossoms anymore, who the hell did this?! You better 
	show yourself now!
Another incident? (I can't deal with this)/(I can't be bothered)/(I'm not doing this
	/ignoring it)... It's a pain, but guess I'll go mop it up.
I'm skilled, I'm quick, I'm strong! The Hakurei Shrine Maiden is passing through!

月が欠けてんぞ、どうなってんだ！？
紫の野郎が騒いでるじゃねえかよ、 誰の仕業だ、 早く出て来い！
また異変かよ、もうやってらんねぇぜ…　面倒だけど、 一丁シメてくるか
上手い、早い、強いのハクレイミコが通る！

The moon ain't full? What the hell is goin' on!?
That damn Yukari can't stop cryin' about it, who did this?! You better show yourself
	now!
Another incident? (I can't deal with this)/(I can't be bothered)... 
	It's a pain, but guess I'll go mop it up.
