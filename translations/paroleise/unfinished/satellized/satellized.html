			<h2>Translation Notes</h2>
			<p>
				This is probably the most ambiguous song of the small amount
				I've translated. Because of that, I felt the need to add in 
				my best guesses of what the subjects and/or agents are to 
				some of the lines that are only one word in Japanese. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The original songs for satellized are Love-colored Master 
				Spark and The Witches' Ball, both Marisa's themes from 
				different games. Inspired by the album cover for 
				dialogue～Stella Theater～ by kimino-museum and other 
				art I'd seen from different arranges of The Witches' 
				Ball, I was originally going to translate this as 
				Marisa "pursuing" Alice or Patchouli, but the 
				general theme of this album is about Reimu and Marisa.
				Further, this song, unlike The Hakurei Miko Passes Through, 
				does not contain any explicit references to anyone 
				else. As a result, I kept with Marisa's point of view
				and translated the lines where pursuing something or someone
				is described broad.
			</p>
			<p>
				That said, what exactly Marisa is pursuing is never spelled out. 
				It seems that what she's chasing is related to the person 
				she goes somewhere with in the fifth verse. Assuming that that 
				person is Reimu, I expand on this thought in the following 
				paragraphs.
			</p>
			<p>
				In line 2.3, what is actually being recalled by Marisa is 
				up to interpretation. Given the verses after this line,
				it could be that she's chasing after Reimu's shadow, i.e.
				trying to match her in some quality such as strength, 
				incident resolving (a reference to The Hakurei Miko 
				Passes Through perhaps), etc. If you were to instead 
				look at verse 1, it may be that Marisa is chasing 
				after something more concrete, like an item or book,
				a possibility informed mostly by line 1.5. I left out 
				any specific guesses as to what the "item" being pursued
				was due to this. As a related aside, the path from line 
				2.1 could also be a metaphorical path rather than a 
				literal one, but the dual interpretation is easy to 
				convey with the simple translation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Line 3.1 is translated as dashing up to the distant 
				future, but what is actually being dashed up towards
				could also have been the hill in the next line. This 
				would leave the <span lang="ja-jp">未来遠く</span>
				as simply a statement on the future being distant.
				I went with the former because another verb is 
				already attached to the 
				<span lang="ja-jp">星の丘</span>, though the 
				meaning would fit if Marisa dashed up to the hill,
				then travelled up it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Line 6.3 also had a lot of thought put into it because 
				of how many meanings <span lang="ja-jp">向こう</span>
				has. It could mean a/the destination on the hill, 
				the other side (the decline opposite to the incline
				Marisa goes up) of the hill, and simply, somewhere 
				beyond the
				hill. I went with the latter because I felt the 
				first two assumed too much information I didn't 
				have. Contrary to this sentiment of not wanting 
				to assume too much, I assumed that 
				the "it" Marisa is chasing in line 6.2 (which is
				maybe the same as the "it" she tries to recall
				in line 2.3) is located beyond the hill because 
				the line says 
				<span lang="ja-jp">丘の<u>その</u>向こう</span>
				instead of just 
				<span lang="ja-jp">丘の向こう</span>. Of course,
				I could be reading into it too much, but the 
				assumption ties up the verse neatly.
			</p>
			<p>
				This wraps up my thoughts on my translation choices which
				I thought warranted an explanation. Now,
				I would like to give an alternate interpretation to the 
				song. As can be seen from my commentary above, I assumed
				that what Marisa is pursuing is located in the real world,
				or at the least, within the normal bounds of her travel 
				in Gensokyo, whether that be Reimu, or something else.
				Instead, Marisa may be chasing after someone who is 
				deceased, that being Reimu of course. This interpretation
				is motivated by fanworks portraying Reimu as remaining a
				human throughout her life and Marisa eventually choosing to
				become a (youkai) Magician and 
				<span lang="ja-jp">未来</span> being able to be translated
				as "the world beyond the grave". With such an interpretation,
				the first verse can be seen as Marisa currently being in the 
				living world (note the mention of the summer and the exhilarating 
				wind) and looking for clues on something. Perhaps that something
				may be on how to get into the afterlife while still living. This
				line of thought can be continued into the second verse, where
				Marisa is lost on a path she followed to the afterlife. Lines
				2.3 and 2.4 could then be detailing how she's been lost for so 
				long that she forgot what she came here for and even when she 
				remembers it, she no longer cares. Climbing up the hill of 
				stars could be a reference to going up to heaven, and maybe
				the path she was lost on was on that hill. The fifth verse 
				then becomes about how Marisa reclaims her will to chase 
				after Reimu in the afterlife and that she knows magic 
				precisely for extraordinary times like this. Finally,
				the last verse is about her giving up on the chase and 
				accepting Reimu's death. This verse may even signal that
				Marisa was still human and not a youkai during this whole
				ordeal. There were many leaps of logic along the way, but
				there are lines in the song pointing toward this, so maybe
				this interpretation is correct. Likely not though, and I 
				did not translate the song with this interpretation.
