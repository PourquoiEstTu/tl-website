たとえ明日「君の物」ではなく「空の何か」でも
今だけは私を必要として

What if, rather than being "your possession", I was instead "something hollow" tomorrow
Even then, at least just for now, treat me like I'm necessary

帰る場所なんて無いまま独り
夢も見ないで
生ける意味もなく佇んだ街
涙も枯れて
冷めた朝の風咲く
夜めて眠りにつく花弁
閉じた瞳は紅く
連れ出して　君の側へ

I'm alone 
Without any dreams, without any place I could so much as call home
My tears dry up, there's no meaning in living 
The town stands still
The cold morning wind blows
When it stops, the flower petals fall, asleep
Those closed eyes are scarlet
Take me away　To your side

side-by-side tl(Without a place I could so much as call home, I'm alone 
Without dreaming 
Without any meaning in living, the town stood still 
Even my tears dried up 
The cold morning wind blows
The flower petals stop and fall asleep at night

Take me away　To your side
)

この身体で何が出来るか
隣におく価値はあるのか
守りぬく強さを貫けるか

What can I do with this body?
Is there any worth in keeping me by your side?
Can I keep the strength to stick with you until the end?

たとえ明日心移ろう声に惑い消されても
変わらず君を愛する
君の中の大切な者に私はなれなくても
構わない
今はそばに居させて

Say a coquettish voice erases your infatuation with me tomorrow
(Even then,) I won't change, I will still love you 
Even if I can't become someone precious to you
I don't care
For now, let me stay by your side

温もりの闇に包まれ独り　視界曇らせ
あの日の約束　選んだ場所で
言葉も枯れて

That place we chose　That day's promise 
The darkness' warmth engulfs me, isolates me　My vision clouds over
(Even) My words dry up 

Side-by-side tl(
I'm engulfed by a warm darkness, isolating me　My vision clouds over

永遠など無いと分かって
終わりがくることを恐れて閉じた厚い扉叩き壊せ

I know that something like eternity doesn't exist
I'm scared that the end is coming, and yet I still break down the heavy, closed door 

たとえ明日君の夢が崩れ全てが変わっても
離れない終わりが来るまで
何も救えず朽ち果てた先で朝を待てるなら
信じたい
今は抱きしめていて

Say your dreams crumble and everything changes tomorrow 
Even then, don't leave me until the end comes
In the ravaged future, where nothing is saved, if you can look forward to the next morning
I want to believe in you
Please hold me close 

このまま時が止まっても満たされない
夜に咲く花のように
求められぬまま散っていっても

Even if time stopped right now (in this moment) (it wouldn't be enough/I wouldn't be satisfied)
You're like a flower that blooms in the night
Though your petals scatter when I don't want them to

たとえ明日君の夢が崩れ全てが変わっても
離れない終わりが来るまで
何も救えず朽ち果てた先で朝を待てるなら
信じたい
今は抱きしめていて
たとえ明日「君の物」ではなく「空の何か」でも
