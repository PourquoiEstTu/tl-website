			<h2>Translation Notes</h2>
			<p>
				I made the line breaks between verses myself since the lyrics don't have any. 
				They're based on how the song flows so they shouldn't be too off?
			</p>
			<p>
				The second verse/stanza was definitely the most difficult to
				translate. I felt like there were a lot of different ways to 
				arrange the lines. It might have made sense to group  
				the first two lines along with the fourth and have the third 
				as the 
				stand-alone since I treated it as the "conclusion" of the 
				first half of the stanza. Specifically, it concluded Sakuya being
				alone and transitions into the second half of the stanza where
				Sakuya seemingly finds or is found by Remillia. 
				I ended up grouping the first two lines
				together and then the fourth with first half of the third 
				line. I'm fairly sure that the third line shouldn't be translated
				literally as "A town that stood still without any reason to live"
				since the rest of the stanza seems to talk about Sakuya before
				she started working at the Scarlet Devil Mansion. So, I used 
				the "the town stood still" part to transition into the second half
				where Sakuya supposedly meets Remillia. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The rest of the second
				stanza was mostly straightforward except for
				<span lang="ja-jp">"夜めて"</span> in the 6th line. I couldn't 
				find any word that matches up with online at all besides 
				<span lang="ja-jp">"夜目"</span> which is a noun. If "in the 
				dark" or "seeing in the dark" was the intending meaning, 
				I feel like the 
				<span lang="ja-jp">"て"</span>-form for nouns and not for 
				ru-verbs would have been used. It was
				pronounced as <span lang="ja-jp">"やめて"</span> in the song,
				so I decided to interpret it as the flower petals move in the 
				morning because of the cold morning wind, but then stop 
				(fall asleep) when
				the morning wind stops at night. I think it reads well, but 
				I'm not very sure if its correct translation.
				<!--I haven't checked yet but I don't know
				if there's a canon interpretation to how Sakuya got employed at
				Scarlet Devil Mansion -->
			</p>
			<p>
				Lastly, I wanted to mention the translation for the first line 
				of the 4th stanza,  
				<span lang="ja-jp">"たとえ明日心移ろう声に惑い消されても"</span>.
				<span lang="ja-jp">"心移ろう声"</span> was a really difficult one.
				A definition I found for <span lang="ja-jp">心移ろう</span> was
				"change the target of someone's love/affection to something/
				someone else" or more 
				more generally, "someone's feelings changing". I initially 
				decided to translate this as "fickle" since I couldn't think of 
				any word or phrase which meant the same and flowed well. "fickle"
				somewhat encapsulates the feeling of love and a kind of 
				arbitrary-ness I wanted compared to a word like 
				"capricious" which doesn't really have the nuance of 
				love/affection. After messing around with a thesaurus for a bit,
				I ended up at "coquettish" which gives off the same kind of 
				jumpy "arbitrary" feeling as "fickle" and also has the nuance of 
				being flirtatious and teasing which I thought fit well as a 
				description of a voice. The 
				flirtatious nuance fit well with the translation I went with for 
				<span lang="ja-jp">惑い</span>. Of the possible translations,
				I thought "illusion" and "infatuation" fit the best. 
				"Illusion" fit well since for this line in particular, 
				it captures a feeling of overestimation and being overexcited 
				about something which may not have been impressive or worth 
				being excited about. In the context of the song, I felt like it 
				could have meant Remillia got bored of Sakuya's time-stopping 
				ability or of her perfection as a servant. The reason I went 
				with "infatuation" over it was because of the connotation of 
				love/affection coming from <span lang="ja-jp">"心移ろう声"</span>.
				"Infatuation" can capture the same meanings "illusion" can but 
				can also more explicitly carry meanings of love, usually intense
				love. For example, 
				an obsessive, overwhelming love, or a love that disregards 
				all faults in one's partner could be interpretations drawn from the 
				word. I intend it 
				to mean the same as what I wanted "illusion" to represent except
				with a more concrete connotation of love. Its a more 
				specific word than "illusion", so it may be 
				easier to come up with a different interpretation than mine 
				while reading, but the same idea is conveyed so it's fine to me.
